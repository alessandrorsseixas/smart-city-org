Vision Document: Smart City Automation Project
1. Introduction
This project aims to create a smart city automation system controlled via APIs developed with Spring Boot. The project involves a simulated smart city with two houses, a moving car controlled by sensors and cameras, and energy generation via wind and solar power, all orchestrated through Arduino controllers. The generated energy will be stored in a battery system to power the houses and charge the car. Additionally, the system will integrate with Alexa for voice command control. The user will be able to control the city via a web system and mobile apps (iOS and Android). Microservices architecture will be implemented to support all the functionalities, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

2. Vision
This project will enable users to interact with and control a smart city environment in real-time. The system will consist of various microservices and hardware components that will simulate energy generation and consumption, automation of houses, and vehicle movements. The goal is to create a system where users can experience the possibilities of smart cities and renewable energy through an interactive model.

3. Scope
Energy generation via wind turbines and solar panels, stored in batteries.
Control of two houses including lights, temperature, and appliances.
Car automation with sensors and cameras for movement control.
Integration with Alexa for voice command control.
Web application to control and monitor the smart city.
Mobile applications (iOS and Android) for remote control.
Notification service for real-time alerts via email, SMS, push notifications, WhatsApp, and Alexa.
4. Architecture Overview
This project will utilize a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability. Below is a plain text representation of the architecture.


Microservices:
 - House Control Service: Controls lights, appliances, and HVAC systems in the houses.
- Car Control Service: Manages car movement based on sensor input and camera data.
- Energy Control Service: Manages energy generation from solar and wind sources, energy storage, and distribution to houses and the car.
- Notification Service: Handles real-time notifications via email, SMS, push, WhatsApp, and Alexa notifications.
- Alexa Service: Dedicated service for communicating between Alexa and the smart city components.
- Auth Service: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- Cache Layer (Redis): Stores frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ): Ensures reliable communication between microservices.

Hardware Components:
- Arduino Uno: Controls house appliances, car movement, and energy generation hardware.
- Wind Turbine: Simulates wind energy generation.
- Solar Panel: Simulates solar energy generation.
- Battery System: Stores energy generated by wind and solar panels.

5. Technology Stack
- Frontend: Web app with Angular, mobile apps for iOS and Android.
- Backend: APIs developed with Spring Boot.
- Microservices Communication: RabbitMQ for message queuing.
- Database and Caching: Redis for caching, MySQL/PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
- Authentication: Auth microservice for user login and management.
- Integration: Alexa service for voice commands, notifications via Email, SMS, Push, WhatsApp.
- Hardware: Arduino Uno, sensors, wind turbine, solar panels, and battery system.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: The system should be able to handle multiple devices and users interacting simultaneously.
- Performance: Efficient use of resources, especially for real-time control of devices.
- Security: Secure authentication and authorization for all users accessing the system.
- Extensibility: The system should allow future additions, like more houses or vehicles, with minimal changes to the architecture.
